I was looking for options to get better than ADSL internet for my rural house. I had a prepay [Skinny 4G Broadband](https://www.skinny.co.nz/broadband/)  Huawei b315s-608 modem.

I couldn't purchase the 300GB/$59 pack for my address so wondered how I can achieve a reasonable* price for high data usage. Figured out that $5/24 hour unlimited Data Binge would give me a max price of $200 a month.

It would probably only be cost effective if monthly usage were greater than 4x120GB.
