It's been more than a year since I last posted on this blog.   This is probably mostly because my \_real\_ blog is [my website](http://master5o1.com/), which kind of acts as a web-CV, without the personal info that a CV provides.

  

I don't really like blogger much, but that's because the template system is shit and I wanted to have a very transparent white background where the main blog posts are.  Instead I had to have none and darken the text on my page background.  Fuck you blogger template designer.  Fuck you.

Ok, so maybe that was a little harsh.  Blogger does allow me to input CSS, but I have no fucking idea which classes to use to override the colours.  Perhaps I'll have to figure out something else.

  

This is generally going to be a ramble blog about geeky things that interest, influence or affect me in some way.

  

I would like to treat you to an image that I cooked up earlier.  It's of one of my lecturers for Computer Science, and she tends to make things plural.  My friend imagined her using the Enhance image filter algorithm that TV overuses just a bit too much.  But VisualBasic has never had a better plug than CSI.
