I've built a new site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  I hope this can help me with making a few things simpler.

I've got a small [python script](https://git.1j.nz/jason/1j.nz/src/master/scripts/gists.py) that gets my [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/master5o1/) and builds them as files for Hugo to understand.

I've imported a bunch of old [blogger](https://master5o1.blogspot.com/) posts.
