Yay! New version of [my website](http://jason.schwarzenberger.co.nz/).  
  
Using Google apis on the Node side of things. Meaning I have scrapped the Angular for posts and routing. Might put back some Angular routing later.  
  
I've noticed that the Google+ api now shows where a post was shared to (Public, a community, etc). It also shows reshare details. Something that was missing and looked odd before.  
  
I've added Blogger api integration which means that my blog posts on [master5o1.blogspot.co.nz](http://master5o1.blogspot.co.nz/)Â will come through to the _ramblings_ section.  
  
Still to come:  
  

*   Pretty up the [list of creations](http://jason.schwarzenberger.co.nz/Creations) page.
*   Add some sort of caching so that Google API requests aren't done all the fucking time.
*   Make the app generic, with a separate theme. Release this thing on GitHub so that it may be reused by anyone else who wants a Google+ and/or Blogger based website.
